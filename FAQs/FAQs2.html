  <h4><strong>Q: I'm confused about online sessions. Where do I sign my child up? How do online sessions work?</strong>
    A: <em>Most of your questions about Online Sessions are answered on our recently-revamped Existing Parents page.</em> <a href="http://irvinekumon.com/existing-parents/"><u><strong>Click here</strong></u></a> and read through our detailed guide to setting up, attending, and signing your child up for online sessions!

  <h4><strong>Q: We used to take our child to the Kumon Center twice a week. Why are online sessions offered once a week? Can we request additional online sessions?</strong>
    A: <em>COVID-19 has forced us here at the Barranca and Campus Centers to hold teacher-led sessions online.</em> We understand that online learning is frustrating and inefficient if too many students are served at once, so we've drastically reduced our sessions' student-teacher ratio to maintain high-quality student-teacher learning time.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that each session has no more than two students to a teacher, our teacher availability is limited. Because of this, we have enacted a loose "one session per week" policy; if your child needs more than one session per week, please contact us and we'll do our best to accomodate.

  <h4><strong>Q: How do I get homework for my child during the COVID-19 outbreak? How do I turn in their completed homework?</strong>
    A: <em>Request 2-3 weeks' worth of homework from your center by submitting your center's online HW Request Form.</em> <a href="http://irvinekumon.com/homework/"><u><strong>Click here</strong></u></a> to learn about our homework system (during the COVID-19 outbreak). Note that the two centers have different Homework Exchange Guidelines; please read through carefully.
  </h4>
  <h6>   </h6>
  <h4><strong>Q: How do I home-grade my child's homework? When should I be home-grading?</strong>
    A: <em>Home-grading should be done daily, just after your child is done with their homework.</em> To learn everything you need to know about home-grading, <a href="http://irvinekumon.com/home-grading-guide/"><u><strong>click here</strong></u></a> and read our detailed guide!

  <h4><strong>Q: At what age can my child start at Irvine Kumon? How early is too early?</strong>
    A: <em>Many of the students at our centers started Kumon at the age of 3 - 3.5.</em> However, we have accepted students as young as 2.5 years old. As soon as your child is potty trained and can understand basic directions, he or she is ready to join! The importance of prekindergarten education today cannot be overstated.

  <!-- According to the OC Register article below, research shows that the "earlier students start learning math, the more likely they will attend college and land in high-demand careers."

  <h4><strong>Q: Is every Kumon center the same? What's special about these two centers?</strong>
  A: <em>No. Kumon is franchise-owned, so while all Kumon centers have the same educational materials, each center is owned, staffed, and operated differently!</em>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Kumon centers owned by Janie Choi (Barranca and Campus) are longstanding bastions of excellence among the Kumon centers in Irvine. Janie Choi established the first Kumon center in Irvine on Barranca parkway back in 1990, providing over 30 years of educational service to the community. Then in 2004, Janie established the Campus center near UC Irvine.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have witnessed and adapted to 30 years' worth of evolution in educational policies, standardized testing, technology, and college admissions. Through it all, we've helped thousands of kids practice the skills they need to become better writers, readers, mathmeticians, and ultimately, better <em>learners</em>.

  <h4><strong>Q: How long will it be before I see results in my child's progress?</strong>
    A: <em>Kumon is designed to be a long-term program</em>. While your student's confidence in math and reading will grow every day with practice, the greatest benefits of Kumon typically become apparent after one year. Every Irvine Kumon student will be able to advance <em>beyond</em> his or her grade level with patience and dedication. Like with sports and music, there is no such thing as a short-cut to success!

  <h4><strong>Q: How do I enroll my student at Irvine Kumon?</strong>
    A: <em>Email or text us to schedule a free one-to-one Zoom session with us for your Parent Orientation and Student Testing.</em> Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, prospective parents would join us for an in-person Parent Orientation and Student Testing at one of our centers.
