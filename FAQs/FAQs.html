	<li><strong>Q:</strong> At what age can my child start at Irvine Kumon? How early is too early?</li>
	<li><strong>A:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>The typical starting age at our Irvine Kumon centers is 3 - 3.5 years old.</strong> However, we have accepted students as young as 2.5 years.  As long as your child can 1. hold a pencil and 2. follow instructions, he or she is ready to join!  The importance of prekindergarten education today cannot be overstated.  According to the OC Register article below, research shows that the "earlier students start learning math, the more likely they will attend college and land in high-demand careers."<a href="http://irvinekumon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Chart.jpg">

	<li><strong>Q</strong>: Is every Kumon center the same?</li>
	<li><strong>A:</strong> <strong>No</strong>.  <strong>Our Irvine instructor Janie Choi has 25 years of experience in education</strong>. She established the first Kumon center ever in Irvine in 1990 and has since touched thousands of local students' lives.  While the Kumon curriculum is consistent across North America, each Kumon center is an individually owned and managed franchise.  The Irvine Kumon on Barranca (in Woodbridge) and on Campus Drive (by UCI) are both owned and operated by Janie Choi and her experienced team. "Since Kumon is franchise, you would think they all should be the same, but no, by far this one in Irvine is the BEST, we drive from Anaheim for our kid to have this kind of atmosphere, great place." - Yelp Review 2014</li>

	<li><strong>Q</strong>: How long before I see results in my child's progress?</li>
	<li><strong>A</strong>: <strong>Kumon is designed to be a long-term program</strong>.  While your student's confidence in math and reading will grow every day with practice, the greatest benefits of Kumon are typically experienced after one year.  Every Irvine Kumon student will be able to advance <em>beyond</em> his or her grade level with patience and dedication.  Like sports and music, there is no such thing as a short-cut to success.</li>
