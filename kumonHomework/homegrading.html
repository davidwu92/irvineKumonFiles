  <h2 style="color:rgb(211, 0, 0);font-weight:500;text-align: center"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2>
  <h4><strong>Q: When should I be home-grading my child's work?</strong>
    A: <em>Immediately after your child is done with their homework.</em> Students best-learn from their mistakes when the mistakes are pointed out and corrected without any delay!
  </h4>
  <h6>  </h6>
  <h4><strong>Q: Do I write a score for each individual page, or one score for the whole packet?</strong>
  A: One score for the entire packet. For example, you should only write <span style="color:red;font-weight:500">-5</span> <em>once</em> on the front page of the packet if your child missed five questions throughout the whole packet.</h4>
  <h6>  </h6>
  <h4><strong>Q: What if my child is still having trouble with a question after two tries? What do I do with their second, incorrect response?</strong>
    A: Incorrect answers should be worked on, by the student, until they reach the correct answer! Only then should you proceed to circle the question in blue. <em>If your child is having lots of trouble with a particular concept/question, <strong>write it down</strong> to discuss with a teacher in class (in an online session, at the moment).</em>
