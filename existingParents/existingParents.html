  <h1>Online Kumon Sessions During COVID-19 Closure</h1>
If you are interested in online learning sessions, please book a session below for your child! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Online sessions are to be 1x weekly per student</span>.  In order to increase quality of our online sessions, we have reduced the student:teacher ratio down to 1:1 private sessions for Kindergarten &amp; younger, and 1:2 for 1st graders &amp; up.  For double subject students, you may book a 40 minute session 1x a week, or 20 minute sessions 2x weekly.  Please book separate sessions for siblings.

Zoom Links will be sent out via email the evening before, or the morning of your appointment, no later than 10:30am.  Please double check your Spam folder for these Zoom Links.  Please make sure to use your unique Zoom link for each new meeting, and <strong>do NOT</strong> re-use old Zoom links.

Please keep the following things in mind to maximize your online sessions:
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Be prompt</strong></span> - Sessions are capped at 20 minutes, and because of the appointment nature of our scheduling, we cannot go over on time.</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Be prepared</strong></span> - Have your student's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">WORK FOR THE DAY</span> or any <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PREPARED QUESTIONS</span> ready before your child starts their Zoom conference, in order to maximize your student's scheduled time.</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Be close by</strong> </span>- We ask that parents stay close by to assist younger students with the conference, if needed.</li>
 	<li><b><u>Home-grade and have your child make corrections</u></b>- Success with learning at home requires that parents be involved with home-grading and asking students to correct their mistakes.  This will also assist your child with having questions or help prepare for their Zoom sessions. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yifZSf4bLpCmZr_72Njy8dJHyiumoE_h/view?usp=sharing">Click here for our center's simple grading method.</a></li>
</ul>
Thank you so much for joining us for our online sessions.  We are asking parents to please be patient with us as we are navigating remote learning for the first time, and doing our best to make it as smooth and widely available as possible, while keeping our staff safe and healthy.  Thank you again and we can't wait to see your child online!

If you need assistance with booking a session, please text us at Barranca: 949-651-1200 / Campus: 949-854-6284!
