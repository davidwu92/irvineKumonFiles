<h1>COVID-19 Update &amp; Temporary Center Changes</h1>
Dear Kumon Family,

We are writing to inform you that the Kumon centers in the Irvine and Tustin area have decided to temporarily suspend in-person sessions due to the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).  This situation will last until things are deemed safe to reopen.

<strong>Irvine Kumon (Barranca &amp; Campus) will be suspending in-person class sessions starting Saturday 3/14/20.  However, our center will remain open and operational during regular business hours to provide HW pick-up and exchange for all families during this time.  </strong>All students who come to the center during this week will <u>automatically receive 2 weeks of homework to take home.</u>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>No Touch HW Exchange- via TEXT</strong></span></h2>
<strong>Barranca Center: 949-651-1200</strong>
Please include your child's first &amp; last name, and subjects.
HW requests are being fulfilled on a rolling basis.

<strong>Campus Center: Submit your Request <a href="https://forms.gle/P6dr27hkqNmnbci17">Here</a></strong>
Please send in your requests by Wed night, and HW will be left out weekly by Thursday night of every week.

HW is being left outside the center, alphabetical by last name.

<strong>Please DROP OFF completed &amp; graded HW</strong>
when you pick up more work in our designated HW drop box outside the center.  Homegrading during this time is <em>absolutely critical</em> for your child's success during this period.  Please contact us immediately if you need an Answer Key. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yifZSf4bLpCmZr_72Njy8dJHyiumoE_h/view">Click here for our center's easy homegrading method!</a>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Online Kumon Sessions are Now Live!</strong></span></h2>
<a href="http://irvinekumon.com/existing-parents/"><b>Book your child's online Kumon session here. </b></a>
Session are hosted 1x weekly via Zoom due to decreased student-teacher ratios. The sessions are a fantastic opportunity to create a sense of routine, accountability, and regular teacher-interaction for your students studying at home.

<strong>It is important that your child's education and progress is not interrupted during this extended period.  </strong>During this temporary class suspension, it is <u>absolutely critical to home grade</u> your homework daily. Home grading provides immediate feedback to both parents and students, enabling students to learn from their mistakes while the concepts are fresh in their mind.  All families are welcome to request additional HW as needed during this time, as well as any Answer Keys you may need.

Your child's welfare is our utmost concern, and we will closely monitor the situation and will contact parents for continued updates.

For questions, please email us irvinekumon@gmail.com, or <strong>TEXT </strong>or <strong>CALL </strong>us at: <strong>Barranca  949-651-1200</strong>  /  <strong>Campus 949-854-6284.</strong>

Thank you for your patience and understanding during this situation.

All the best,
Janie &amp; Michelle Choi
